## My Ethical Hacking Journey:
I started my journey into cybersecurity with an interest in networking, which led me to earn my **CCNA Certification**. As I deepened my knowledge in networking, I became more interested in **Ethical Hacking** and **penetration testing**. Today, I focus on finding vulnerabilities in digital systems and improving their security through responsible and legal means.

I actively participate in **TryHackMe(Labs), PortSwigger(Labs)** challenges, where I improve my hacking skills in a safe, competitive environment. These challenges have helped me master the tools and techniques required to identify security flaws in real-world applications and networks.
A Bug Bounty Winner regularly participates in platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, and also offline discovering vulnerabilities in real-world applications while earning rewards and enhancing cybersecurity skills.
