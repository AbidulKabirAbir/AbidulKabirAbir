## My Ethical Hacking Journey:
I started my journey into cybersecurity with an interest in networking, which led me to earn my **CCNA certification**. As I deepened my knowledge in networking, I became more interested in **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing**. Today, I focus on finding vulnerabilities in digital systems and improving their security through responsible and legal means.

I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, where I improve my hacking skills in a safe, competitive environment. These challenges have helped me master the tools and techniques required to identify security flaws in real-world applications and networks.
